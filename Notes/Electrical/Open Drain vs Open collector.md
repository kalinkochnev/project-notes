- "Open drain" can be illustrated by an an output pin being connected to the "drain" pin of a MOSFET
- Open drain outputs require a [[Pullup and Pulldown resistors]] in order to properly output high
- R is chosen to limit current so output of N-FET is not damaged

- "Open drain" refers to MOSFETs performing the function, while "open collector" refers to the collector of a BJT
