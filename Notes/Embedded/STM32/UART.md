## COM_TypeDef Not Defined
I was trying to debug this issue. I was pretty sure that this wasn't something that I caused and had to be something automatic from Cube. I checked out the previous commit and everything was fine. I did a diff for the important autogenerated files and saw some minor differences with pinouts and stuff. However there was a file `stm32l4xx_nucleo.h` that had an include guard like this
```c
#if (USE_BSP_COM_FEATURE > 0)
#if (USE_COM_LOG > 0)

#if defined(__ICCARM__) || defined(__CC_ARM) || (defined(__ARMCC_VERSION) && (__ARMCC_VERSION >= 6010050)) /* For IAR and ARM Compiler 5 and 6*/

#include <stdio.h>

#endif

#endif
#endif
```

and in `stm32l4xx_nucleo.c`
```c
#if (USE_COM_LOG > 0)
static COM_TypeDef COM_ActiveLogPort;
#endif
```

The location of the actual defines was in `stm32l4xx_nucleo_conf.h`. I tried modifying the USE_BSP_COM_FEATURE to be 1. However there were other complaints with includes. To fix them I had to import 
```c
#include "stm32l4xx_nucleo_conf.h"
#include "stm32l4xx_nucleo_errno.h"
```
in `main.h`.  I am disliking the fact how cube can make breaking changes and there is no idea why. But the [[Git#Compare file across two branches]] strategy worked very well and shed some light on this hidden issue.
