## Periodic sampling
- We cannot distinguish between a sine wave of frequency $f$ (freq of wave) sampled at $f_s$ (sampled frequency) or any integer multiple of $f_s$
$${\displaystyle \sin(2\pi (f+Nf_{\rm {s}})t+\phi )=\left\{{\begin{array}{ll}+\sin(2\pi (f+Nf_{\rm {s}})t+\phi ),&f+Nf_{\rm {s}}\geq 0\\-\sin(2\pi |f+Nf_{\rm {s}}|t-\phi ),&f+Nf_{\rm {s}}<0\\\end{array}}\right.}$$
-> there are an infinite # of sinusoids a sampled signal can match to (if multiples). Smallest frequency sinusoid is considered
-> if N < 0, you will get negative frequencies which also match the sinusoid


## Aliasing
**Alias**: when different signals from reconstructed samples are indistinguishable from others
-> the two black dots from $[0, f_s]$ ghave an alias (aka duplicate) at $[f_s, 2f_s]$

- Nyquist frequency is minimum freq in order to reconstruct a sinusoid (rate sampled must be at least 2x as large as frequency)
-> ex: human hearing is 0-20kHz, but discs need to sample at 40kHz minimum
$$\frac{f_s}{2} > f$$
### example
![[FFT_aliasing_600.gif]]

**Upper left:** Animation depicts a sequence of sinusoids, each with a higher frequency than the previous ones. These "true" signals are also being sampled (blue dots) at a constant frequency/rate, f s . ![f_s.](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7b685a349b3a4c2980d9fd90234e3b485dbcff42)   
**Upper right:** The continuous Fourier transform of the sinusoid (not the samples). The single non-zero component, depicting the actual frequency, means there is no ambiguity.  
**Lower right:** The discrete Fourier transform of just the available samples. The presence of two components means the samples can fit at least two different sinusoids, one of which is the true frequency (upper-right).  
**Lower left:** Using the same samples (now in red), the default reconstruction algorithm produces the lower-frequency sinusoid.

#### explanation
-> Notice bottom right (discrete sampling) far left band increases which makes reconstructed signal frequency to increase.
-> when they cross at the folding frequency ($f_s /2$) the reconstructed signal (bottom left) starts to decrease.
**this is b/c the lowest frequency is taken to be the reconstructed signal** 

### another example of aliasing
![[Pasted image 20230210173050.png]]
-> comment: in DSP there are (+) and (-) frequencies, but in continuous real case it is only from $[0, B]$
-> 2-4c is undersampling

- Signal/noise above/below B/-B will **always** end up in the band of interest $[-f_s/2, +f_s/2]$
- In practice, need a low pass filter on the continuous signal

## Bandpass sampling
- You don't sample signal centered at $f_c = 0$, but instead at a new center frequency w/ specific bandwidth

### example ($f_c=20mHz, B=5 mHz$)
- According to Nyquist, we need to sample at 2x the highest freq component (2 * 22.5 mHz) = 45 mHz, but we can shift the signal first before measuring to only sample at a lower frequency
- But b/c we are in discrete case, we get aliasing with duplicates (b). So in actuality, we only need to sample at 17.5 mHz which shifts the aliases back to 0
- $f_{s}=f_{c}-\frac{B}{2}$ applies to the periodic sampling formula: $\sin(2\pi f_{s}t+\phi )$ . This expands to $\sin\left( \left( 2\pi f_{c}- \frac{1}{2}2\pi B \right)t + \phi\right)$
