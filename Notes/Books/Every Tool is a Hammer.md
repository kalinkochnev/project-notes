- "You've got to do at least six iterations, minimum, of any project before it starts getting food enough to share it with other people"
- "progressing as a maker means always pushing yourself through those momentum killers"
# Lists
=="think of all the perfectionists who can't get started unless they have everything exactly right, in exactly the right order"==
-> perfectionism isn't just striving to make perfect, but it is striving to match your vision with reality

=="list's aren't so much guides as they are maps through an ever changing landscape"

- Use check boxes. Full `[X]` mean complete. `[\]` Means at least halfway, `[ ]` Not started/no measurable progress

- Lists describe mass of project. Check-boxes describes the momentum. **Momentum is key for finishing a project**. Forward progress enables plugging away at monotonous tasks.
- Create a daily checklist of tasks, copy over incomplete from previous day, but also compare with overarching project list to check progress

### List-making process
*Create a master list*
1. **Brain dump**. Create a sacrificial list of all things you think need to get done. Broad strokes
2. **Big chunks**. Identify major categories within brain dump list and expand upon each category.
3. **Medium chunks**: Reorganize the items within each category into subcategories.
4. **Begin!**
	- identify the hardest problem and start there. Cracking it gives a lot of momentum and you can coast on the easy stuff

- Develop more lists. Daily lists. Specific component lists. 

5. **Take a break**. If you temporarily abandon a project, create a list that indicates your current progress, next steps, what is needed for next steps.
