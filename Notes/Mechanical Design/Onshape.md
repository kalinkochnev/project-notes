## Importing solidworks assemblies
- Make sure the zip file you upload into onshape has the EXACT same name as the .SLDASM file

## Treat assembly as "frozen"
- If you import an assembly from solidworks, you may want to retain the exact position of all the parts. In order to not have to redefine all the mates, you should select all the parts and group them together

# Structure
- A single document should contain all models necessary for a project/assembly
- A single parts studio is used only for creating models/parts that are geometrically related to one another. Ex: fidget spinner and bearings
- You can create multiple parts studios. No need for different cad files for organization
- You use assemblies for putting together different components created in parts studios.
