- $K_{v}$ rating of a motor is the ratio of unloaded rotational speed to peak voltage on wires
$$
K_{V}=\frac{\omega_{no-load}}{V_{peak}}
$$
- Once back emf of a motor == battery voltage, this is the maximum speed of the motor
- Back EMF constant and motor torque constant are used interchangeably

- The electrical motor time constant $\frac{L}{R}$ represents how long quickly the motor settles to current/voltage
