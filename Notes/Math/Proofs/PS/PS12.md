#### Consider the function $f: \mathbb{Z}_{3}\to \mathbb{Z}_{12}$ defined by $f([a])=f([4a])$.
**A) Prove that f is well defined and not bijective**
To prove that f is well defined:
1) F must be a relation from $\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ to $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ such that $f \subseteq \mathbb{Z}_{3} \times \mathbb{Z}_{12}$
$f$ is a relation by definition because $f$ is a function (a set of ordered pairs that map from $\mathbb{Z}_{3}\to \mathbb{Z}_{12}$)

2) Every element in $\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ is related to some element in $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$
$f$ is the relation defined as $f=\{ ([a],[4a]) : [a]\in\mathbb{Z}_{3}, [4a]\in\mathbb{Z}_{12} \}$

3) No element in $\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ is related to more than one element in $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$
If $f$ is well defined, every input should correspond to only one output.  If the inputs are equal, the outputs should be equal. 
Assume that $[a],[b]\in\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ and $[a]=[b]$. Since $[a]=[b]$ then $a \equiv b \text{ (mod 3)}$
$$
\begin{align}
a\equiv b\text{ (mod 3)} \\
a-b = 3n; n\in\mathbb{Z} \\
4a-4b=12n \\
4a\equiv 4b \text{ (mod 12)}
\end{align}
$$
So $[4a]=[4b]$, which is the same as $f([a])=f([b])$. Therefore $f$ is well defined. 

**A2) Show that f is not bijective**
$f$  is not surjective and as a result is not bijective by counterexample. There does not exist $[x] \in\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ such that $f([x])=[5]$

**B) Show it is injective**
To show that $f$ is injective, show that $\forall x,y \in \mathbb{Z}_{3}, x\neq y\implies f(x)\neq f(y)$
Proceed with a proof by contrapositive. Let $[x],[x']\in\mathbb{Z}_{3}$. Suppose that $f([x])=f([x'])$.
Therefore $[4x]=[4x']$. For equivalence the classes to be equal, $x$ must be related to $x'$. So $4x\equiv 4x'\text{ (mod 12)}$
$$
4x-4x'=12n; n\in\mathbb{Z}
x-x'=3n
x\equiv x'\text{ (mod 3)}
$$
Therefore, $[x]=[x']$ as needed.
