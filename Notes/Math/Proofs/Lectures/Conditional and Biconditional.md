$P\to Q$ is only false when P is true and Q is false. 

## Equivalent Logical Forms
$P \to Q=\sim P \vee Q$
$\sim(P\to Q)=P \wedge \sim Q$

## Necessary/Sufficient conditions
**Necessary condition:** Q is necessary for P because the truth of Q is guarenteed by the truth of P
**Sufficient condition:** P is sufficient for Q because when P is true, Q is true
