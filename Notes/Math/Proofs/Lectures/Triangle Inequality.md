Think of the absolute value as the distance between two things ($\mid x- y\mid$)

# Theorem
If $x,y,z \in \mathbb{R}$ then $|x-y| \leq |x-z|+ |z-y|$

## Corollaries
#### When $z=0$
$|x-y| \leq |x| +|y|$

#### ** When $z=0$ and  $y$ replaced w/ $-y$
$$
\begin{align}
|x-(-y)| \leq |x| + |-y| \\
|x+y| \leq |x|+|y|
\end{align}
$$
#### When $y=0$ and $z=-y$


## Visual explanation

- The distance $\mid x-y\mid$ (the hypotenuse) is always smaller than the sum of the legs $\mid x-z\mid+\mid z-y\mid$
- However this is really one dimensional along a number line

- All the different cases show the inequality holds
