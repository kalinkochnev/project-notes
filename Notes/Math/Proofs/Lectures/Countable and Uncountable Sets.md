- **Theorem** -- If $A$ and $B$ are countably infinite, so is $A\times B$
- Any countable infinite set has cardinality $\aleph_{0}$

# Set A is...
**Countably infinite** - $|\mathbb{N}|=|A|$
ex: $\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{N}$
**Countable** - if A is finite or **countably infinite**
ex: $\{ 1,2,3,4 \}$
**Uncountable** - A is infinite and no bijection $\mathbb{N} \to A$
ex: $\mathbb{R}$


# Countably infinite sets
- A set A is countably infinite iff its elements can be arranged in an infinite list $a_{1},a_{2},\dots$

# Examples
Is $Q$ countable?
- Can we list all elements of Q so that we "get them all" 
- Can't just follow along first row since an infinite list. Will never reach end and start the next row
- Have to snake around in order to reach all numbers
- Need to remove numbers that are duplicates to ensure a bijection

# Discussion
How do we show that if $A$ and $B$ are countably infinite, so is $A \times B$?
- We do a similar snake pattern to create a bijective function where we create the grid of all pairings
