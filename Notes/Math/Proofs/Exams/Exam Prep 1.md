## Incorrect
- What is the converse? Inverse? Contrapositive?

Set types (integers, natural numbers, rational, real, empty set, matrices)
Cartesian product
-   Express a cartesian product of A_1 x â€¦ x A_n with set builder notation
-   Does R x N x Z == R x (N x Z)?   
-   Does M_3x2 == R^6?  

Subsets
-   What is required to be a subset of another set?
-   How many subsets does a set have? How can you generate the list?

Power sets
-   What is the powerset of P({ empty})?

Indexed Sets:
-   How do indexed sets work?

Set Operations
-   How do you prove that an item in one set is an item of another set?  
-   Does (R x Z) intersect (Z x R) == Z x Z?
-   Does (R x Z) union (Z x R) == R x R?
-   Assume K != 0, J subset_eq I. Which of the following is true and why:
$$\bigcap_{\alpha \in I} A_{\alpha} \subseteq \bigcap_{\alpha \in J} A_{\alpha}$$   $$\bigcap_{\alpha \in J} A_{\alpha} \subseteq \bigcap_{\alpha \in I} A_{\alpha}$$
Complements
-   What is the definition of the complement?  

Number sets:
-   Does every non-empty subset of Z have a least element?

Divisibility:
- What does it mean something is a multiple?
- What is a divisor?
- What is even parity or odd parity?

**Proof techniques:**
1. Direct proof
2. Proof by [[Proofs by Cases]]
3. Proof by [[Proof by Contrapositive]]
4. Proof by [[Proofs by Contradiction]]
5. Asserting a statement is false by counter example

**Proof tips:**
-   If need to prove an element is a subset of another
-   If proving P and Q, prove P and Q separately (proof by conjunction)
-   If proving P or Q, prove P, Q in separate cases (proof by disjunction)
-   Universal quantifier: If a proof works for all x, then must be true. To prove false, just need to find a single x that is not true
-   Existential quantifier: If there is a single case of x where true, then must be true. To prove false, need to show that all x is false.
