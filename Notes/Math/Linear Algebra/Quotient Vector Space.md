We can construct a vector space that satisfies certain conditions that we want. 

For example, maybe I want to construct a vector space such that I have all parallel lines to $N$. 
Let $V$ be a vector space in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and $N$ be a subspace (a line in this case). 
We define a new vector space called $V / N= \{ x+n : n\in N \}$, which basically says if I take any x vector and add a vector in n, then it will give me a new line parallel to N. take any x vector and add a vector in n, then it will give me a new line parallel to
