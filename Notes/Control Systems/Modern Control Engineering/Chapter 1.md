- Block diagrams represent information or product output of system operation
# History
- Classical controls is single input/output
- Modern control theory represents dynamics of real system, but sensitive to error (multiple input/output)
	- uses time domain analysis for stability
- Robust control uses time and freq. analysis for stability

## Common tools
- Bode diagrams are used to ensure linear control system (CS) meets perf. reqs
- Root locus methods leads to => stable systems
- PID controllers can be tuned by Ziegler-Nichols rules

# Definitions
**Controlled variable** - quantity/condition that is measured/varied by controller
**Control signal** - quantity/condition varied by controller to affect the controlled variable
ex: speed of car = controlled variable, pedal depression = control signal

**Plants** - any physical object to be controlled
**Processes** - any operation to be controlled
	ex: chemical, economic, and biological processes.

**Systems** - a combination of components that act together and perform a certain objective
**Disturbances** - a signal that adversely affects the value of the output of a system
**Feedback control** - operation that reduces `error = target - actual`

**Closed loop control** - uses feedback to update reference input
**Open loop** - output has no effect on control action
# Examples
**Speed control system**:
Plant/controlled system = engine, `error = desired speed - actual speed`. Control signal = amount of fuel
