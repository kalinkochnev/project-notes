> >  first technique is ideal integral compensation, which uses a pure integrator to place an open-loop, forward-path pole at the origin, thus increasing the system type and reducing the error to zero

> [!PDF|note] [[Control System Engineering.pdf#page=463&selection=17,41,20,11&color=note|Control System Engineering, p.362]]
> > second technique does not use pure integration. This compensation technique places the pole near the origin, and although it does not drive the steady-state error to zero, it does yield a measurable reduction in steadystate error

> > Steady-state error can be improved by placing an open-loop pole at the origin, because this increases the system type by one

> > If we add a pole at the origin to increase the system type, the angular contribution of the open-loop poles at point A is no longer 180Â°, and the root locus no longer goes through point A, as shown in Figure 9.3

> > To solve the problem, we also add a zero close to the pole at the origin, as shown in Figure 9.3(c). Now the angular contribution of the compensator zero and compensator pole cancel out, point A is still on the root locus, and the system type has been increase
