- What do the X and Z gates do?
- Isn't every entangled state a separable statement?

2. Why is it not possible to distringuish non-orthogonal states?


## Tensors
4. How do the scaling and additive property of tensor products make sense intuitively? What do the operations looks like
the tensir represents a way of looking at their joint state, but you can zoom in amd look at the states individually since it is still two particles but in a joint system
affecting the phase of one of the particles afects the phase of the joint system

it is not possible to distinguish what the phase belongs to. it could belong to particle 1, 2, or the whole system 


## Chsh game
- Go over formula for probability of winning the game with quantum vs classical
a +b hve to be aero and last column must be 0 you can at best only fill in 3 columns 

# DJ algorithm
- What affect does applying the hadamard once more have on the input register? 
If you don't use 1st hadamard, it is really only classical
If you apply 1st hadamard, it creates the superposition of all the output states with the phases, but measurement is really only picking a single outcome with probability $\frac{1}{2^{n}}$

- Why does measuring the input register end up giving us the answer?
It just depends on the algorithm. Sometimes we have 

- Why do we pick $\ket{0\dots 0}$ to measure on?
