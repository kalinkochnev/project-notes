**Approach**
1. **State variable selection**: a subset of all possible system variables and call the variables in this subset state variables (all other values can be solved using these variables)
2. **State equations:** an nth-order system, write n simultaneous, first-order ODEs in terms of the state variables
3. If we know the initial condition of all of the state variables at $t_{0}$ as well as the system input for $t\geq t_{0}$ , we can solve the simultaneous differential equations for the state variables for $t\geq t_{0}$. 
4. **Output equation:** the state variables with the systemâ€™s input and find all of the other system variables for $t\geq t_{0}$.

> > choose the state variables as the quantities that are differentiated, namely v C and i L. Using Eq. (3.20) as a guide, we see that the state-space representation is complete if the right-hand sides of Eqs. (3.22) and (3.23) can be written as linear combinations of the state variables and the input. Since i C and v L are not state variables, our next step is to express iC and v L as linear combinations of the state variables

- Example: We only need one variable in order to solve for a mass and a viscous damper b/c it is a first order equation.
$$
M \frac{dv}{dt} + Dv = f(t)
$$ 
- However we might want to determine the position over time, so we add an integrator.

> > to convert a transfer function into state equations in phase-variable form, we first convert the transfer function to a differential equation by cross-multiplying and taking the inverse Laplace transform, assuming zero initial conditions. Then we represent the differential equation in state space in phase-variable form. An example illustrates the process.
