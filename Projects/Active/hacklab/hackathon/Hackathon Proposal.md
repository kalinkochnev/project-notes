# Methodology
- Infrequent hacking events at uconn
- Events are viewed as "pitch competitions"
- Grassroots event
- Lean team can quickly organize events with minimal overhead.
- Hold multiple hackathons a semester.
- Coordinate with makerspaces on campus to act as overflow capacity of main space.

Hackathon are events where individuals or teams come together to rapidly develop creative solutions to specific challenges. Participants use their problem solving skills to build prototypes around a particular theme. The purpose of a hackathon is to foster innovation, learning, collaboration, and encourage participants to showcase their creativity. 

However


universities and other communities alike. They are fun and rewarding events for the participants. 
Hackathons at UConn currently do not encourage the maker spirit. The interest in the event feels artificial and manufactured. Partiicpants feel that it is a pitch competition where things don't actually get done. It is whoever has the best idea. Ideas are good, but execution is where it matters. Incentives to win are a sub-optimal incentive to learn. Yes, students may learn, but they may choose to take actions that maximize their chances of winning instead of their actual benefit. For instance, people may feel pressured to build a website or mobile app because that is one of the only things achievable in 24 hours.
Many hackathons have an outsized preference towards certain fields. This hackathon wants to encourage people from *any* major to come and build something together. Examples: writing a book, designing flyers or graphics for a social cause

[[ModesofMaking.pdf]]
**Imitation**: Working from a set of steps to build foundational skills, basic knowledge, and hands on experience
**Modification**: Remixing existing ideas and objects with tools, materials, and techniques with which you have become familiar
**Innovation**: Combining previous experiences and skills to create something new and bringing those ideas into the world

## Objectives
- **Learning Over Winning**: Emphasize the hackathon as a learning and growth opportunity rather than a competitive event.
- **Encourage Execution**: Participants should focus on bringing their ideas to life, even if they're not perfect.
- **Foster Collaboration**: Build a sense of community where participants can meet potential future collaborators.
- **Inclusivity Across Disciplines**: Design the hackathon so that students from various majors can participate and benefit, promoting interdisciplinary collaboration.


- Host a close-knit, small scale (and more frequent) hackathon
- A successful outcome is a participant executing their plan.
- Have made new acquaintances that may be their future collaborators!
- Collaborate with multiple clubs and/or organizations.
- Participants learn to operate under constraints (time and resources)
- Create a welcoming environment for both beginners and experts
- Regardless of major, people should be able to benefit.
- Everyone should learn how to learn - strategies for taking things on.
- Students should hopefully have an interest to continue working on their projects.
- Have fun!


# Introduction
This hackathon emphasizes, above all else, your execution of your idea. Good ideas are valuable, but following through on what you promised is much much harder.

Like the inventor of the ubiquitous Linux operating system, Linus Torvalds, once said: "Talk is cheap. Show me the code".

The goal is that you *will* have built a complete project by the end of this hackathon. You might not have built a world-changing invention (you may have!), but you will have labored over something that you can proudly call your own. And ultimately the goal of this hackathon isn't to win. It is to learn, make friends, and have a good time. I have deliberately structured this hackathon to de-centivize winning and incentivize thriving, unlike most hackathons.

Living in the realm of what *could be* is enjoyable but is like a vapor: it disappears quickly and without a trace. Learning to operate in the realm of real, visible outcomes is scary for more reasons than I can list here, but it is where long-lasting fulfillment lies. Even if your project is hacked together and held by duct tape, it is something to be extremely proud of. Because you lived in reality instead of your dreams.  

# Themes

## **"Push the Limits"**
This theme focuses on leveraging what you already know to tackle challenges that are just beyond your usual scope. In other words, we want you to push the boundaries of what you can accomplish using your current skills and knowledge.  This theme emphasizes the power of applying one's strengths effectively to create impressive outcomes within a short time frame. This track focuses on innovation and novelty. 
## **"Break the Mold"**
This theme encourages encourage participants to try something completely new and outside their current skill set. This track is about stepping out of comfort zones and embracing the challenge of the unknown. This may mean learning a new skill, following a tutorial, technology, or framework. Success here is defined by the quality of your learning experience and not necessarily how impressive your project is.
## **"Iterate to Innovate"**
This theme focuses exclusively on the iterative process of improvement. Teams pick an existing idea, project, or concept and improve upon it. This could involve adding new features to existing projects, optimizing or fixing bugs, or taking inspiration from an already existing idea. We encourage you to avoid re-inventing the wheel here.

# Awards
Awards that people only meet the criteria for will be given out. Not all awards may have winners. Some participants/teams may receive more than one award.

**"Excellence in Execution"**: For the team that most effectively brings their ambitious idea to life, demonstrating high-quality execution within the time constraints.

**"Fearless Innovator Award"**: Awarded to the participant or team that takes the biggest leap into uncharted territory, embracing new technologies, frameworks, or concepts they've never worked with before. Your prior qualifications and experiences will be used to judge your submission

**"Mathematical Mastery Award"**: Awarded to the project that involves the most sophisticated or innovative use of mathematics, showcasing advanced mathematical concepts, algorithms, or modeling. This award celebrates participants who push the limits of computational and mathematical thinking to achieve impressive results. Submissions that make use of libraries with no significant expansion may be excluded.

**Wildcard Award**: Awarded to a project that stands out for its sheer unpredictability and uniqueness. This award celebrates creativity that is unexpected and unconventional.

**Hacker Spirit Award**: Awarded to the person or team who engages most thoughtfully and genuinely with the event, showing collaboration, enthusiasm, and a positive attitude.

**Most Creative**: For the team or individual with the most unique and imaginative idea or solution, showing originality and creative thinking.

**Most Playful**: For the project that has the most playful and entertaining vibe, showing that hacking can be fun and lighthearted.

**"Evolution Award"**: For the project that shows the best evolution from a basic or initial version to a more advanced and robust solution. This recognizes the journey of continuous improvement and iteration.

**Competitor Award**: Every participant who completes their project and demonstrates it receives this award, recognizing their commitment to following through.

**Best Collaboration**: Recognizes the team that works together most effectively, showing excellent communication, teamwork, and synergy.

**Most Beautiful Design**: For the project that is the most aesthetically pleasing, demonstrating exceptional attention to design, visual appeal, and overall presentation. This award celebrates the beauty of elegant visuals and thoughtful design.

**Innovation through Disruption**: For the project that challenges existing norms or disrupts conventional thinking in its field, offering a fresh perspective or alternative solution. 

**Catalyst for Change**: For the project that most effectively drives social impact and advocates for meaningful change. This award recognizes innovations that not only address pressing social issues but also create a ripple effect, inspiring and mobilizing others towards positive action
