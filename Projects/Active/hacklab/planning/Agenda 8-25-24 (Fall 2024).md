1. Expectations for the semester
	1. Be honest about what you have time for, and if you need more time. If we aren't honest with each other then that disables my ability to lead and organize effectively.
		1. Approx how much time can you dedicate per week. Be realistic.
	2. Respect each other's time. Minimize time wasting activities (meetings, administrative overhead). Prepare ahead of time. In the time it takes me to organize people to do something the actual task can get done by one person.
	3. Meet once a week for 15-25 mins as a progress update. I will go over objectives for the week. Prepare to answer 
		1) What I am working on, 
		2) When will it be done (realistically), 
		3) How or if others help
		4) This may evolve over time
	4. Check the officer channel regularly
	5. Update progress on tasks on the platform we decide.

2. Club priorities
	1. Focus on our core: people who are already passionate. Provide services/events for them
