# Today's plans
- [x] Program the convex optimization of the matrix!
# Timecard
3 hours
# Recap
- It is almost right? My code gets a value of $\lambda=0.035362243652344$ while just estimating the plot it gets $\lambda=0.01375$. The parameters I am using are
$$
\begin{align}
T=100 \\
\overline{R_{i}}=1 \\
Pr=10 \\
k=1.5 \cdot 10^{-4} \\
l = 0 \\
a_{U} = \sqrt{ \frac{2*Pr}{R_{i}} } \\
\omega =0.1; \\
m_{0}=0.01 \\
A_{V} = 0 \\
A_{U}= a_{U}\cos(\omega t) \\
B_{U} = \frac{1}{\omega}(\sin( \omega t) -1) \\
B_{V} = 0 \\
f=0
\end{align}

# Documents worked on
# Plans for next time
Meeting 3-27-24
- [ ] Simulate the 4x4 system with complex random initial conditions for pressure, velocity, etc ode45 matlab to estimate the largest growth rate
	- [ ] generate figure
- [ ] Try trend of changing richardson and oscillation frequency to see if we have same qualitiative description as them (see in abstract for more info)
- [ ] Make heatmap plot for  m_0 and k and coloring based on growth rate
- [ ] Recreate figure 10 and 11
- [ ] Rederive the matrix for the 2D model (eq 13)
