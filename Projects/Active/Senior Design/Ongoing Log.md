Summary of findings:

**The problem:**
Given the toolpath generated by the slicer, find the trajectory that 
1) Is non-colliding with the part and the other arm
2) Covers the entire toolpath
3) Is smooth/continuous (as much as possible)
4) Minimizes pauses due to collision avoidance
5) Roughly equal layer completion time

**Potential assumptions we can make**
- We do not need an optimal path but one that satisfies all constraints.
- Certain operations have higher priority than others (support first, walls second, infill third, etc)
- At certain points the robot may be able to switch between operations if it would prevent collision (ex: begin printing at a different section while the other robot finishes their part)
- "there are many ways to skin a cat" - the tool path plan does not need to be followed exactly to have the same result
	- For instance during infill, the path needs to cover the specified area. It doesn't matter in what manner as long as the filament is deposited at the proper location.
	

**Findings**
[[RRT literature review.pdf]]

- Artificial potential fields are unattractive due to local minima solutions. 
- Algorithms like A* find optimal paths but do not scale well with large search space
- Optimization based planners struggle as constraints increase.
- Swarm/bio inspired path planning are not as effective at searching

**Potential ideas**
- We may be able to use the slicer output to make informed "live-reslicing" to account for potential collisions
	- The DMA-RRT algorithm allows agents to modify each others paths to avoid collisions
	- We can exploit the "many ways to skin a cat" idea to find an alternative path that has practically the effective same result as the path planned by the slicer.
