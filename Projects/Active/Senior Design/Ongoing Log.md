Idea: what if for every pair of arms we calculated the trajectories that would result in a collision instead of the trajectories that wouldn't .

Then we plan with the explicit goal of avoiding those configurations

- Maybe I can somehow integrate this with a motion planning RRT solution to generate paths that are feasible as well as alternative configurations

## Things to look into
Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF)
robot arms in common workspace
distributed manufacturing
multi agent shared resources
- We need to consider planning and control as one

## Questions
What is the problem called if I already know that path I need to go on but need to decide how to coordinate it?
- The only thing you can change is how you speed up items over time

## Summary of findings:

Hi everyone. I found what I think is a very promising method to solve the collaborative aspect of the motion planning problem. It uses Rapidly Exploring Random Trees. I believe this might be a very good method to use for motion planning

I will update this post as I do more research. And feel free to ask me questions or ask for clarification because I didn't have time to elaborate on all the topics.

Rescsanski, Sean attached is the paper for the DMA-RRT algorithm. Please skim it and let me know if this is something you think I should investigate further.

**The problem**  
Given the toolpath generated by the slicer, find the trajectory that   
1) Is non-colliding with the part and the other arm  
2) Covers the entire toolpath  
3) Is smooth/continuous (as much as possible)  
4) Minimizes pauses due to collision avoidance  
5) Roughly equal layer completion time

**Potential assumptions we can make**

1) We do not need an optimal path but one that satisfies all constraints.
2) Certain operations have higher priority than others (support first, walls second, infill third, etc)
3) At certain points the robot may be able to switch between operations if it would prevent collision (ex: begin printing at a different section while the other robot finishes their part)
4) _"there are many ways to skin a cat"_ - the tool path plan created by the slicer does not need to be followed exactly to have the same result.
    - For instance during infill, the path needs to cover the specified area. It doesn't matter too much as long as the filament is deposited at the proper location in a smooth manner.

**Findings**
[[RRT literature review.pdf]]

- Artificial potential fields are unattractive due to local minima solutions. 
- Algorithms like A* find optimal paths but do not scale well with large search space
- Optimization based planners struggle as constraints increase.
- Swarm/bio inspired path planning are not as effective at searching

**Potential ideas**
Some of these are pretty out there but I think they might be possible so lets try to debate them before we reject them.

- We may be able to use the slicer output to make informed "live-reslicing" to account for potential collisions
    - We can potentially exploit the "many ways to skin a cat" idea to find an alternative path that has practically the effective same result as the path planned by the slicer.
    - We can accomplish this by allowing alternative paths that can resolve a potential collision issue
    - The DMA-RRT algorithm (in the paper attach) allows agents to modify each others paths to avoid collisions to achieve minimize global costs while guaranteeing constraints are met
    - We do not need to re-slice in the literal sense. We can use the slicer output for each layer to determine which paths/points need to be extruded on but the live-planner decides which paths can be modified (like infill) and when to execute them.
## Criticisms
- Assumptions 3 and 4 may not be true depending on the process, for FFF we can be almost certain that they are true but we should verify both assumptions and be able to to implement constraints on them otherwise, just to note.
- adjustments to the path have to be in regards to either the configuration of the arm or the orientation of the end effector w/ some constraints. For instance you can adjust the angle of the end effector to be in a better configuration to avoid a collision
- we don't need RRT at all because we have the set of poses we need to solve the IK solution for just as an example
- There are more details we can talk about later, but infill selection is something that we need to design carefully and there are some good ways to do it
