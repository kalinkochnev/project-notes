## Hub
**Hub** - The place where the spokes of a wheel connect. The "forkend" (the backside two triangles that hold the back wheel) attaches here.

- The "Freewheel" and "Cassette" look almost exactly the same. They hold the back gears when you switch speeds
- Old standard: thread-on freewheels
- New standard: Shimano "Freehub"
	- The ratchet mechanism is incorporated onto the hub
	- **Cassette** - the sprockets (gears) are sold as a set/one piece for convenience

- When sprockets spin, the toolfitting (the teeth near the axle) spin if it is a cassette/freehub
	- Freewheel => toolfitting stays in place
