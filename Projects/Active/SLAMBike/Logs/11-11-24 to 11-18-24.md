## Recap
- We had a meeting with Ken yesterday to discuss the electronics schematics I made

Revision 0:

Revision 1:

- So in Revision 1, several things were mentioned. 
	- Ground loops essentially happen when the the grounds are at different potentials from one another. If they are at different potentials then there is a voltage differential between two parts of the circuit. [See more here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_loop_(electricity))
	- Ground loops can be addressed if everything is tied to the same ground.
	- So the isolation in this case is not needed. I just need all the potentials to have the same $0V$ reference.
	- The buck convert thing is fine, again tie to 0V
	- The optocouplers are not longer necessary. However a solution needs to be found that 
	- I still need to increase the voltage of the microcontroller output to be from 0-3.3 to 0-5.5V

- We tried to hook up a potentiometer to the bike motor controller but it didn't work. We are not sure why
	- This post has a very detailed write up [Guide to Hall Sensor Throttle operation, testing, and modification.](https://electricbike.com/forum/forum/kits/golden-motor-magic-pie/70584-guide-to-hall-sensor-throttle-operation-testing-and-modification)
	
**Priorities**
- 
- Mechanical design of the bike
	- Mount Servo
	- Timing belt
	- Training wheels

## Recap
- We took off the stem of the bicycle (I think that is what the handlebars are called). I am planning to attach a pulley along the stem so everything is closer to the bike frame

- I am trying to find a belt and pulley that would work for this

## Plans for next time
- [ ] Figure out what optocouplers to buy
- [ ] Figure out belt and pulley sizing for the bicycle (pulley length may not matter all that much)
- [ ] Take measurements of pulley mount area. Go to hardware store and buy PVC stuff
## Recap
## Documents worked on

## Notes
**Reference self driving bicycle design**: https://cad.onshape.com/documents/6a4d5f660a0578611fcba6f2/w/fb38613a3897b8260665e8d2/e/351fede9d4d354cfa128e2c9?renderMode=0&uiState=67327e20e04dc155197bab98

Problem: Have two separate power supplies. One for the microcontroller and the other for the motors so operation of the bicycle does not affect operation of the microcontroller. I need to step down the 42V battery to 7.6V to operate the servo motor. I also need to  
## Questions
What software should I make schematics/circuit designs?

### Power and signal distribution
- How do I avoid ground loops? What even is a ground loop?
- How do I isolate the microcontroller power source and the bike power source while still signaling to the other?
	- Similar problem: https://forum.allaboutcircuits.com/threads/isolate-microcontroller-circuit.154412/
	- Optocouplers? https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/blog/optocoupler.html
	- Star grounding? https://resources.altium.com/p/using-pcb-star-grounding-can-keep-your-design-shining
- Is there a reason not to use optocouplers?
	- https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/13amidt/is_there_a_reason_not_to_use_optocouplers_aka/
- How do I signal at a higher voltage?
	- A mosfet/opamp circuit should do the trick
	- https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/30737/transistors-and-pwm
	- https://embeddedrelated.com/showarticle/77.php
- Are there any things I should be aware of when using a buck converter?

### Bike throttle
- How do I control the bike throttle voltage?
	- Probably a transistor. 
- Am I sure the throttle operates as a hall sensor. And do hall sensors effectively act as potentiometers?
### Servo motor
- How do I control the servo motor with PWM?
	- The motor does not appear to need to be controlled at the same voltage as the power supply for the motor. Meaning I can use 5V to power the 7.6V servo motor
	- The guy in this forum post has the same exact motor as me:

### Servo motor mechanical
- What kind of belt and pulley can I use to mount to a servo?
	- https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/3o2qxq/timing_belt_pulley_for_micro_servo/
- How do I mount the servo to the bicycle?
