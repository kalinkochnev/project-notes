# Today's plans
# Recap
I was getting an `EncoderError.NO_RESPONSE`. See [forum post](https://discourse.odriverobotics.com/t/internal-short-on-axis-0/10546) for more info. It turns out that the [[6-18-23#ODrive pinout |ground pin]] is being shorted with the B channel pin. I will try resoldering the header.

That didn't work. I'm so annoyed. It seems like the issue is an internal short. The one odrive that I randomly chose has an internal short *facepalm*. I will have to use open loop control on the flywheel. The guy in the video said that's what he did. I will have feedback on the axle.
