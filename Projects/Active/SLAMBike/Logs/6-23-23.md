# Today's plans
# Recap

I figured out what is actually causing my axle friction problems. The encoder is screwing me over right now. There is some kind of misalignment between the encoder and the axle. The AMT-102 encoder is supposedly a no-contact encoder, which means there shouldn't be any friction! However, you have to align everything almost perfectly. I believe I have everything lined up axially properly. However there is some wiggle with the axle through the bearings. I think this is causing some

- 56 seconds from 90 deg w/ encoder
- 2:57 seconds from 90 deg w/o encoder
