# Today's plans
- [ ] Install linux 22.04 on the agx 
# Plans for next time
- 
# Recap
- Bro the AGX wasn't detected because (A) it needs to have a direct connection and not through a USB hub and (B) apparently the AGX has a preference for which usb ports you plug into on your computer. 
- You can ssh to the device with where the ip comes from `wlan0` on the `inet` property
```
ssh nvidia@10.194.95.195
```


- A new nasty error has come up. The board information was not properly read from eeprom

## SSH to device
**How to set up SSH Outside UConn -** 
`If you are outside UConn, a VPN is required to ssh to the computer in-lab.` Follow these instructions to set-up Cisco AnyConnect VPN: [https://kb.uconn.edu/space/IKB/10907091023](https://kb.uconn.edu/space/IKB/10907091023 "https://kb.uconn.edu/space/IKB/10907091023") 
Once set up, you should be connected to UConn's network. Follow the instructions for outside lab to ssh. 

**Outside Lab -** 
`If you're outside the lab, but in UConn (or outside UConn w/ a VPN), contact someone in lab for the IP.` Run in your terminal:

`ssh amber-uconn@insert-ip-here`

Replace 'insert-ip-here' with the IP. In-Lab - `If you're in-lab and someone outside the lab asks for the IP, type this in the terminal of the computer:`

`curl ifconfig.co`

This will get the PUBLIC IP. (edited)
