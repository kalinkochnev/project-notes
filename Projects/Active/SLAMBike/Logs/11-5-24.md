# Today's plans
# Plans for next time
# Recap
- We are going to mount training wheels on the bicycle
# Documents worked on

# Notes
- Mounting training wheels is difficult. Vihaan is going to talk to sean to get his thoughts.

Current ideas:
- Add a bracket to extend a training wheel set
	- Cons; Need to extend axle length on back wheel, 
- PVC tube on down tube
