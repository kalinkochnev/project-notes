# Today's plans
- [ ] Upgrade the jetson to ubuntu 22.04
- [ ] Install ROS

# Plans for next time
# Recap
- The NVIDIA Jetson AGX refused to be detected by the nvidia sdk
- The debian package from nvidia's site was using Jetpack 6
	- We saw that jetpack 5.1.4 is the latest version that supports the jetson agx and it requires ubuntu 20.04

- Thankfully nvidia provides a docker image with the proper OS (this wasn't there when we did the NASA challenge) and a CLI tool to flash a new operating system

- The install failed. This is a known issue:
>When installing JetPack SDK using the SDK Manager Docker image, you should first install `qemu-user-static` and `binfmt-support` on your host machine, then run the following command on your host machine:
    sudo update-binfmts --enable
    Without these steps, you will get the following error during installation from the File System and OS component:
    'dpkg': Exec format error

- I didn't have time to finish installing the image onto the AGX. Use this link:
	- https://docs.nvidia.com/sdk-manager/docker-containers/index.html
Command I used:
```
docker run -it --privileged -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb/ -v /dev:/dev -v /media/$USER:/media/nvidia:slave --name JetPack_NX_Devkit --network host sdkmanager --cli --action install --login-type devzone --product Jetson --target-os Linux --version 5.1.4 --host --target JETSON_AGX_XAVIER_TARGETS --flash --license accept --stay-logged-in true  --collect-usage-data enable --exit-on-finish
```
# Design decisions
- We are going to have the bike motor and reaction wheel motor be powered by the same 48v battery
