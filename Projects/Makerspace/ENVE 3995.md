Marisa

- Multimedia creation
	- Project concept video
	- Proposal writing 
	- Developing 3D models, charts, diagrams

Skills for NASA challenge:
- Learning how to write a proposal, understanding the specifications for the challenge
- Project management fundamentals
- Systems engineering fundamentals
- Doing literature review, see what already exists
- Theory of Creativity and Novelty
- Working in groups and making a plan
- Reaching out to experts in the field (and especially at UConn)
- Recruiting members outside of the class to pursue the project

End of course:
- Plan to write/present rest of proposal

Issues:
- Students will have to work on an accelerated timeline since proposals are sent in 2 months after the semester ends
- Access to machine shop, makerspaces, places to meet out of class are very important
- The necessary expertise for the challenge may not be available
	- ie. there may be more students of one major than necessary, or not enough of one (ex lots of MSE but not enough ME, CS, or Math)
- There is not really a deliverable other than the materials/proposal. Not really service based learning
- The groups/teams will need to reach out to an advisor for them to continue their project/send in their notice of intent
- Only one team can submit from each university, I believe

Considerations:
- Students should be able to choose who to work with. Everyone should be introduced to each other so they know what skills they have to offer

What I like:
- Having check ins and deadlines before our main one would have been very helpful

# Notes
- Class evaluation () and grades separate
- ENGR course special topics
- Instructor should focus, learning objectives, assesments
