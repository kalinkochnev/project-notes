Interdisciplinary design
- 3-4 credits class in Fall / senior design space in spring


## Info
- Trained students work after hours

## Amenities
Space for ventilation
~3,500 square feet
Getting 3d printers with different capabilities

## Connecting students to each other
**Word of mouth!!!!**
Getting mentoring from other students and new hires
Invention grant (grant for learning how to do things)


MechE do like to work with their hands, but CS/EE people like to do that too. They just don't want to pursue it as a career. 

- Connecting students to funding for projects (~$50,000), people to work with, and learning 
	- Connecting professors with students within the school (place for opportunities for everyone) and vice versa
- Act as a place to network
	- Sign up as you walk in to do a project

- Tutorials/videos to teach students,
- Seminars with people who are working on projects
- For 3D printing SoE could cover cost 

## Action items
- 1 page experience of what worked, what didn't
- Meet Anthony after spring break
- Send people we know to Pete if they want to help

# Problems with the challenge
- Fought for necessities: whiteboard, table, drawer
- Bought commonly available parts when it should have just been available
- Printing was a major annoyance
- Lack of skill
- Not enough mentors
- Not enough motivated people
- You don't know what you don't know
- 

## Connections?
- Pete could have helped with project management

# Suggestions
- Scheduling short-term, long-term space scheduling
- Whiteboard paint walls, unlimited post its
- Attract people through example (just do cool stuff)
- Workshops for stuff (project management? machining? soldering/3d printing? rust lmao)
- Welding
- Access to sensors to use and put back
- Borrowing materials like the library. Repository of electronics to borrow
	- People can request new sensors and stuff
	- GPUs i guess
	- Dremel, drill, screws, raspberry pis, monitors, keyboards
- Other consumables
	- Wires, tape, screws
- Organized screw drawer!!
	- Screw sorting robot at entrance lol
- Recruiting corkboard
- Computers: solidworks, pcb design, etc
- **Hackathons**
- Wire EDM machine

## Interior
- Classical mechanisms showcase
- Showcase of projects that have been made
- Scoreboard for hours, or just a cool display
