## Time constant
The reaction wheel book says they have a time constant of "1 minute". According to wikipedia, the time constant "physically"  (whatever that means) is the amount of time the system would decay to 0 assuming it progressed at the same rate of change, but is actually the amount of time it takes to go down to $1/e \approx 36.8\%$ of the original energy. 

I think this is super misleading because the actual time constant parameter $\tau$ is not actually 60 seconds.

$$\begin{align}
E(t)=E_0e^{-t/\tau} \\
E(0)=0.095, E(40)=0.039 \\
\tau = \frac{t}{\ln(\frac{E(t)}{-E_0})} \\
\tau = 6.2831
\end{align}$$

Surprisingly, $\tau = 2\pi$. I have no idea why that could be. But clearly the book is not saying that $\tau=60 [s]$ which would be an insanely high bar to meet.  My pendulum my actually be higher quality than theirs, if I solve the encoder friction issue. After approximately $60 [s]$, the book's pendulum would have lost $96.4\%$ of its energy, which makes a lot of sense (formula $1-e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}}$)
