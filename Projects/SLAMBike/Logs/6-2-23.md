# Plans
I haven't made as much progress as I hoped to make. My plan is still to model the entire assembly but there are some kinks that need to be worked out. I am unsure of what the best solution for having the hinge action is. I think I should go with my original plan and build it before I start worrying about what will work and what will fail.
