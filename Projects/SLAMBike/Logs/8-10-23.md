# Today's plans
# Recap
So I haven't worked on this project for almost 2 months. I was really frustrated by the mechanical engineering aspect of it because it wasn't perfect. I was intimated and annoyed by the fact that I would probably never have a fantastic solution to building an inverted pendulum, but it is probably good enough for my purposes. It really isn't as bad as I make it out to be, and in the future, maybe I'll decide to fix some of the issues now that I have a better idea how to machine.

I spent a lot of time looking at optical encoders to fix the friction issue. I eventually decided it wasn't worth the effort. 

I decided to try programming the odrive with an arduino. That way I can practice a bit of C++ and later switch to rust if I want to try my hand. ODrive already has code to work with the odrive so this makes it much easier to use. I was seriously considering learning how to program the chip on the arduino directly, but I am already too far deep into the rabbit hole and it's time to stop. I am allowing myself to go as far as using `arduino-cli` so I can at least use vim. I wasted a lot of time trying to get the plugins to work. 

# Documents worked on
# Plans for next time
- Measure time constant of pendulum
	- Upload code to arduino and run it
	- Pipe serial monitor to a file for analysis
# Notes
Encoders, for example the AEDM-5810-Z13, have numbers that stand for things. The code represents different parameters to choose from, which can be found in the data sheet. Example:
