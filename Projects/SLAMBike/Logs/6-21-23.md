# Today's plans
- Write code for first experiment and record data (measure moment of inertia of entire system!)
- [ ] Configure the pendulum
- [ ] Initialize the pendulum to 0
- [ ] Measure the starting angle with the encoder
- [ ] Record and save the oscillation data to a file
- [ ] Plot the data
	- [ ] Encoder measurement over time
	- [ ] Total energy over time
- [ ] Measure the frequency of oscillation
- [ ] Develop a model to numerically solve non-linear ODEs with parameters

# Recap
### Motor torque constant
I plotted the data provided with the Antigravity KV300 store page. I should have plotted this way earlier. This would have answered a lot of questions during the amber project. The constant is $k=0.0298$, or according to [this website](https://things-in-motion.blogspot.com/2018/12/how-to-estimate-torque-of-bldc-pmsm.html), $k=\frac{8.27}{K_{v}}=\frac{8.7}{300}=0.0276$. This is for operation at 30 degrees celsius

# Documents worked on
# Plans for next time
## Lab work
- [ ] Pick new odrive, unsolder headers
- [ ] Test odrive with both encoders
- [ ] Conduct 3 trials
- [ ] Measure the mass of the arm
- [ ] Approximate the COM of the arm with a string
- [ ] Estimate the moment of inertia
- [ ] Plug back into computer model and compare

## Mechanical
- Regrease bearings

## Purchase:
- Torque meter
- Cable sleeving
