# Today's plans
# Recap
## Issue 1: Preventing lateral motion along axle
I finished assembling all the mechanical parts. I had to make some adjustments. I am temporarily using the flanges as my shaft collars because the current shaft collars I have are wider than the bearings themselves. So when I attached the shaft collars it would push against the [[Bearings|outer race]] of the bearing and not spin. In order for the bearing to spin freely, the mount must push against the inner race of the bearing. For a permanent fix, I intend on purchasing some bearing spacers/"speed rings for skate bearings". These are the exact same radius as the inner race so you can apply a load to prevent it from sliding. For now I have removed the dust covers to address the issue.

## Issue 2: Motor axle hole sizing
Another issue I have noticed is that the hole for the motor axle to pass through, both on the pendulum arm and the flywheel support, is way way to small for what is necessary. I had to increase the diameter with a drill. 

## Issue 3: Axle grip on pendulum arm
Since it is plastic on metal contact, the arm does not have a very good grip. It isn't bad enough to warrant fixing immediately unless there are issues later on. I tried tightening the screws for better grip. 1 screw tightened did help. 2 screws caused it to snap. It is still working for now. I should consider mounting a flange instead. Or alternatively, I can make the adjustable hole more compliant. In the same way I have a space between the two sides of the hole, I can extend the space further downwards. This is inspired from how the two piece shaft collar works.

Other than that, the components all work pretty well! I'm happy with how it's turned out.
