# Today's plans
- Talk to anthony at the machine shop
- Pick up things from UConn

# Recap
- Contacted Michael, Hritish, Aditya, and Matt about the makerspace open mic
# Plans for next time
## Design
- For the back bearing holder, detach from the base and make it adjustable
- Use a tube instead of a solid axle. Use a larger diameter so I can shove cables through
- Find higher ABEC rated bearings to have less wiggle, also find bearings with larger inner diameter to fit tube. And must be sealed

- Buy batteries for caliper
- Get optical encoder for axle
- Find heat inserts for 3D prints to use as screw holes
- Google 3D print assembly techniques

# Notes
- Rigidity is the same for a tube vs a bar
- Multiple different ways to mount things onto a shaft.
	- C clips: lathe an axle so there is a small decrease in diameter a few mm in length along the axle. Then a c-clip can be stuck on that divot and stop sliding
	- Large step decrease in diameter and slide onto axle
