# Plans
- Connect encoders, motors, and PSU to odrive

# Recap
The slip ring doesnt seem to be a good option because I have an encoder and a motor. Not sure how I would get enough wires for that to work well. I am sure there are issues of noise as well. It seems like all designs. It seems like no matter the design, the issues of wires are always present (however I did see [one design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS-aelfs6S4) use a tube as the axle where they stuffed the wires). See [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQnlQEOMBG4) and here. The wiggling of the pendulum arm is starting to become a problem. I may need to 3D print a new arm to use a flange. I should also consider purchasing some cable sleeving for the wires. If I use sleeving, I should put a hole through the pendulum arm so that I can sleeve all the cables together. 


# Notes
## AMT 102-V
### Wiring
- On the AMT X/Z channel are interchangeable names

| Color  | Type      |
| ------ | --------- |
| Green  | 5V        |
| Yellow | A channel |
| Blue   | B channel |
| Black  | Z channel |
| Red    | Ground    |

## PSU
- `-V` and `+V` have a potential different of 24V
- Black wire is negative, red is positive

## E-stop
- Red connection is Normally closed (NC) while Green connection is normally open (NO)

Using XT60 H-M connectors

- Slip rings
- Rotary transformers are used for high speed or low friction environments

I found this really well designed inverted pendulum: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC4PYbm2NaQ. The description has some really useful information regarding flywheel saturation, gear reductions, and reducing the torque necessary with a counterweight
This one shows some of the control techniques: https://youtu.be/WL5ycezPkIo
- What is dithering? I assume it is when the flywheel starts flying out of control (actually what this is called is saturation)

## ODrive configuration
- Axis 1 is the motor and its encoder
- Axis 0 is the axle feedback encoder
