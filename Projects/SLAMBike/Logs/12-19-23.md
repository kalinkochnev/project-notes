#significant [[Every Tool is a Hammer#Lists]]
I finished reading Adam Savage's book two weeks ago. I feel like I have gained back the confidence in myself to pursue what interests me. I have decided to switch to the robotics major after a lot of thinking.

Now that I am on break, I have the time to finally work on my bike project. I purchased a beautiful bicycle from ebay for $140 [[Expenses]]. I had to drive 2 hours to get it... but it was so worth it. It is exactly what I pictured the bicycle looking for my project. It's vintage!

>Vintage 1980's French H. Mielle Handmade Bicycle.  
>Size XXL (65cm Seat Tube, 61cm Top Tube). I am 6'4" and this fit me great.  
  Handmade in France.  
  Steel tubes with very nice fancy lugs.
  Simplex drive train. With Simplex down tube friction shifters.  
  Red Dot brake levers with side pull caliper brakes fitted with new CoolStop orange pads.
  Fitted with vintage wheels, though 700c wheels will fit and brakes will work. Max tire size around 45mm.

The owner's name is John. He told me to send him pictures of the bicycle working. His number is (213) 379-0255.

One thing adam emphasized to do was have a personally meaningful deadline. Vihaan and I have talked about having a demo at our club fair booth for hacklab. It is on February 7th, 1:00-6:00 PM.
That means I have exactly 50 days to deliver on our demo. 

I think a reasonable deliverable is to have a bike hold itself upright with reaction wheel stabilization. That is the most "novel" and imagination-capturing aspect of our project. Everyone has already seen electric bikes and whatnot. So... 50 days to learn the controls and build the reaction wheel stuff. Seems doable. 

# Today's plans
- [ ] Clarify deliverables for club fair deadline
- [ ] Create task list (adam savage style)
- [ ] Find resources to learn control theory.

# Task list
Goals:
- Design and develop a reaction wheel control system that is bike mountable
- Implement a PID controller to stabilize a bicycle

- Arduino
- Reaction wheel shape/optimization
- Power
- IMU
- Electronics enclosure
- Bike stand
- Controls design
- Bike physics modeling
- Go from inverted pendulum control to bike control

- [ ] 3D print system test
	- [ ] Embedded programming
		- [ ] Arduino communicate to odrive over serial
		- [ ] Send data from arduino to PC over serial (console log)
		- [ ] Live plot data from serial using python script
	- [ ] Learn controls
	- [ ] Controls design
		- [ ] Measure coefficients
			- [ ] Mass of pendulum
			- [ ] Mass of rotor
			- [ ] Moment of inertia (MOI) of pendulum about COM
			- [ ] MOI of rotor about COM
			- [ ] distance from pendulum pivot to COM of pendulum
			- [ ] distance from pendulum pivot to COM of pendulum + rotor
			- [ ] (hard) measure torque of motor over control input range (pg 19)
		- [ ] Stabilized inverted pendulum (milestone)
	- [ ] Mechanical design
		- [ ] Design pulley reaction wheel transmission instead of electrical
- [ ] Bike test
	- [ ] Physics modeling
		- [ ] Bike tipping dynamics
	- [ ] Embedded programming
		- [ ] Receive IMU data over serial
	- [ ] Controls design
	- [ ] Mechanical design
		- [ ] Enclosure for electronics
	- [ ] Electrical
		- [ ] Power motor
# Controls resources
I looked through the textbooks I got from the library and they don't look particularly enlightening. Between the signals and systems book there are probably 1000 pages. As much as I want to learn the theory (which I will have the opportunity to do now that I am in the robotics major), I need to meet my goals. 

This udemy course looks like the best way to get started and make progress with controls quickly.
