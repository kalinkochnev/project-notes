# Recap
I made a bunch of really good progress today. I cast a pretty wide net of things to research. I started with looking up the physics behind gyroscopic motion which lead me down quite a rabbit hole. I decided to focus on gyroscopic motion because it seems like the most compact way to stabilize a bicycle. 

The bicycle stabilization problem is very similar to that of a inverted pendulum. While I was researching pendulum derivations, I ended up learning that there is a specific name for the flywheel stabilization of a inverted pendulum. It's called a **reaction wheel**.

I eventually was lead to Lagrangian mechanics in order to understand how the control system for an inverted pendulum worked. I worked through the derivation of the [[Lagrangian Mechanics|principle of least action]] as well and it seems to make sense.

I make some quick calculations to verify that a flywheel approach to stabilization would work the way I was imagining it to. At first glance it appears to work. However, one question that I have is how a torque applied on one axis of rotation affects another axis of rotation. Once I can answer this, I can formulate the equation to dictate the force applied by a flywheel onto the bicycle (approximately).

- [[Calculus of Variations]]
- [[Lagrangian Mechanics]]

- Any system can be treated as external forces acting on the center of mass of the system
- Struts (a support that maintains a fixed separation) only pushes or pulls longitudinally.
- It is only longitudinal (for a mass-less strut) because if transverse forces were possible, this would result in a torque and infinite angular acceleration (since no moment)

## Controls systems
Amazing textbook for controls: http://databookuw.com/databook.pdf

This is getting very exciting :)

## Inverted pendulum cart physics
$H$= horizontal force acted upon the cart by the pendulum
$V$= vertical force acted upon the cart by the pendulum
$u$= external force exerted upon the cart by the control system
- COM of pendulum changes due to position of the cart and the falling of the pendulum

- Lagrangian of multiple bodies is kinetic energies of all items mins potentials of all items ($L=T-V$)

**Very similar to what we are trying to accomplish (reaction wheel)**
