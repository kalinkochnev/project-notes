# Today's plans
# Recap
I tested all the encoder wires since it appeared there was a loose connection. I first tried moving the motor wires, encoder 1, and then encoder 0 wires. Encoder 0 is when I had issues. I started moving individual wires. Yellow or green looked like the issue. I took out the oscilloscope and confirmed that the yellow wire was loose (I got a lot of noise once I started wiggling it)
# Documents worked on
# Plans for next time
# Notes
- The A (yellow) wire) [[6-18-23#Wiring]] is loose an has some signal issues
- Actually the 5v being loose is the issue
