# Recap
What's better than a 3D printer? Two 3D printers! 

I brought home my old 3D printer that was gathering dust in the basement. This was the first time I had lubricated my 3D printer There's not really enough space to have one printer, let alone two, in a dorm room. 

But now I am manufacturing at full capacity with an Ender 3 and a Monoprice Maker Ultimate. to speed up the manufacturing process. 
I brought back my old 3D printer from my parent's house to speed up the manufacturing time 

# Today's plans
