# Recap
I was a bit slow being decisive with what I needed to do. I was worried that if I dug my head into the theory I would get sucked in and not worrying about constructing a test rig. I didn't do much design work today but I did some initial thinking with sketches for an inverted pendulum design. My requirements are
1. Be able to adjust COM of pendulum to see effects of stabilization.
2. Have the pendulum be able to rotate a full 360 degrees.
I was a bit worried that I wouldn't have a realistic pendulum test since I can only 3d print stuff with not that much mass. However I saw pictures of lots of 3d printed flywheels, so I should be okay. Distance from the axis of rotation matters more (squared relationship) rather than the mass itself. Even though the pendulum model of the bicycle won't rotate a full 360 degrees, there are some interesting nonlinear control schemes to explore whenever I have a chance for the full 360 rig.

I tried importing some models into onshape, but by the end of the day the wifi was crapping out so I didn't really finish doing that. 

I pitched in some money for StuffMadeHere's patreon again so I could get some help. Having someone to ask questions to is unbelievably helpful.

Shoulder bolts have a smooth section at the beginning of the thread to sort of act as an axle. I think this could be a good approach. Also in his design he has two skate bearings he puts in on the Y piece (with a lip to prevent the bearings from falling out). And then he has the threads going through the interconnecting piece to keep it in place.

I also spent 5 bucks to buy [[Advanced_Physics_Nick_Lucid_Jan_2023.pdf]] which is an advanced physics textbook, but looks much more accessible than other things I have seen. The sections on Lagrangian mechanics seem helpful. Today I worked through the equations of motion in [[Reaction Wheel Pendulum.pdf]]. I'm at the point where I should probably be experimenting with something physical. 

Tomorrow I am hoping to design my inverted pendulum in CAD. Also printing those sizing tools on my printer is something I really need to do. I have to worry about requiring the ODrive which is something I have not thought about in- 8mm drill rods (for the axle) a very long time. I'm debating whether I should refactor my rust code to get something working with CAN or just use serial control with python to get something quick and dirty working. My rational mind is telling me to go with python, but I also want to update my odrive package at some point. 

If I somehow have extra time, I will work on the motor dynamics section of the paper.

### Gyroscope vs reaction wheel
- A reaction wheel generally makes small corrections to the angular momentum from a standstill to stabilize/add angular velocity
- A gyroscope is generally used to maintain a specific orientation by spinning very fast. It makes it so the body is resistant to changes in orientation
- A reaction wheel can have a non-zero velocity to have some gyroscopic properties
- Both have very similar designs and use flywheels

### Bicycle info
- Overall length 68 inches
- 15-18 inches road bikes, 20-24 inches wide for mountain
- 17-18lb road bike, 21-29 lb mountain

#### Approximating COM
https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/14009/approximately-where-is-the-center-of-mass-of-a-mountain-bike

Assuming you want the center of gravity of the bike alone (not with a rider), there is a very simple procedure you can perform yourself, as long as you have some bike (you could borrow one):

1. For simplicity, strap the front wheel to the down tube of the bike, so the handlebars won't turn; You could also strap the brake levers in the "full braking" position;
2. Lift the front wheel from the ground, balancing the bike on the back wheel. Lift as much as necessary so the bike keeps almost falling back. Now the vertical line passing through the rear hub is the line where the center of gravity is;
3. Repeat the procedure with the rear wheel lifted, so that you know the the center of gravity is directly above the front hub;
4. The approximate center of gravity position is where both lines cross.

# Questions
- What is an example of a set of coordinates that are not independent for [[Lagrangian Mechanics#Non-conservative forces]] (so it isn't generalized)
- Torque of motor $\tau$ causes $-\tau$ torque on pendulum. Is it because of Newton's third law?
- Why is $\omega_{p}^{2}:= \frac{mgl}{J}$ the frequency of small oscillations of the system?
	- This is for small angles only. We make the assumption that $\sin \theta=\theta$ for small theta for a simple harmonic oscillator
**Solution to simple oscillator for small angles**
$$
\begin{align}
\ddot{\theta}+\frac{g}{l}\sin \theta=0 \\
\ddot{\theta}+\omega^{2}\theta=0 \\
\theta(t)=A\cos(wt)+B\sin(wt)
\end{align}
$$
