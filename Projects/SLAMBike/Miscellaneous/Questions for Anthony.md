**Design Process**
If you're given a project like ours, what would you process be like to go about building it? Are there a certain set of stages you go through? 
- How do you organize brainstormed solutions?
- How do you create a reasonable timeline? How do you keep yourself on track (especially if you are the only one accountable)?

- How kind of calculations do you do to estimate your requirements?
- How do you test your ideas? (test stands) **(we really struggled with prototyping during the project)**
	- What are your recommendations for small-scale testing? 
		*should we create a scaled down bicycle? How do we find motors that are realistically sized?*
	
- What is your process for learning something that you don't understand?
- What do you use to document? What's your format? What do you like to talk about? How do you get yourself to do it often?

**Opinions**
- What is your take on building something in simulation versus prototyping first?
- Would you recommend trying to retrofit a bike immediately? 

**Machining**
- If you had to learn mechanical engineering all over again, how would you learn it?

**Makerspace**
- What needs do you imagine the invention center filling? We have an idea of what problems we want to address, and we have ideas on how we can address them with our own organization, but we don't want to step on your toes.

# Notes
1. Research what's out there
2. Write a mission statement. Define what you want. Break it up into big chunks

"Word salad" - start with a big vision board and cut away (like a clay)
- What are you trying to solve, design intent, user intent, human factors, safety factors, hardware choices, fabrication choices, manufacturing, assembly
- Break the bike/problem into submodules (handlebars, wheels)
- Use Question/Answer format to describe subsystems
- Look at how systems interact with one another
What are you designing? Why are you designing? 

Try to validate as many ideas and narrow down options.

Define the requirements (power, duration, etc)
Throw stupid ideas


- Start small, work up and gradually expand requirements


# Testing theories
**Main issues**
1. How to keep up right
2. How to follow

- What are the ways of keeping upright? How do gyroscopes work? Pendulums? Wide wheels?
- Does something already exist? (segues?) Can you just hack something together? See what others have done and rework them

- Tries 3 things quickly, see what sticks instead of trying to build from ground up. 
- If you try to integrate right away, then you can't isolate what the problem is
- Normally try to work on multiple paths simultaneously, but once getting into nitty-gritty, focus on that
- What's the simplest way to stand something up?

# Ideas
- Single track bike you can stabilize just by turning front wheel
- Use legos?? Makeblock? 
- Linking code commits to specific logs for a project

# 3D Design
- How do you collaborate on 3D models? 
- Look for nuts/bolts CAD files etc on McMaster 
## Finding center of gravity
- Taking staff and moving fingers slowly closer together
- Measuring the weight of a car on each of its four 


# Documentation
- Break up documentation into different modules
- Requirements document
- Write down summaries successes and failures. What your goals/expectations for the day and then how it actually happened.
- Once something works, clean up the documentation/code and summarize everything once it finally works

# Timeline
- Set sub-goals by certain deadlines
- Set weekly goals? How far can we get 
- Backwards induction from a point you want to be in the future to where you are now

# Follow up
- Get the word salad of the makerspace
- Get feedback from Anthony on CAD models
- Get other people involved
- GRABCad Workbench kind of like onedrive version control for CAD. Tortoise SVN free
- Teardowns of segues online or diy on craigslist
- Superpedestrian motor hubs directly on bike wheels

# Next steps
- Establish collaboration procedure

# Goals
1. Prove some theories and get something to test with.
