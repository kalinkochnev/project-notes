[[Agenda 8-25-24 (Fall 2024)]]

What is the purpose of hacklab? What value does it bring? Who does it benefit? What are its goals

Hacklab is the place you go when you want to get something done. They don't have many tools. They have materials to get started at any level and quickly prototype. They have the people who know how to get things done. Our audience is geared towards people who have some experience working on projects. We will try our best to help beginners but it is up to the beginners to seek out help instead of expecting to receive it. We hope to **unify the engineers on campus towards a common goal: working and learning together.** Hacklab is where you go if you want to meet new people to work on a project together. It is where you **go to meet people who really care about what they do**. Hacklab is informal. There is no plan or agenda (most of the time) but if you really need something, it can be arranged. For example... If someone wants to learn a skill, you will be connected with someone who knows it. Additionally, if there are a lot of beginners who want to learn how to get started, we will prepare resources to set them up for success. This will most likely be done through written materials rather than hosting workshops. If there is extreme interest for a particular topic to be taught, it will be done. Time is the most precious resource. **We prioritize freedom to pursue what you want**. We provide services rather than direction. Hacklab has connections to achieve what you want to achieve. Hacklab is for people who have busy schedules. Building things takes a long time, but for the little required time commitment you get a lot out of it. We host community engagement events like hackathons and mixers. H**acklab is for people who know what they want and need help getting there**. **Hacklab is an opportunity**.


# **Mission:**
