## Perspective projection
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_projection#Perspective_projection

**display surface/image plane** - the plane through which the world is projected onto and viewed/displayed onto the screen

**Model matrix** - the vertices are defined relative to the origin of the 3D model frame

- The vertical Field of View is basically the zoom of the perspective (30 deg very zoomed while 90 is not so soomed)
- Need to keep "near clipping plane" as far as possible while "far clipping plane" as low as possible to avoid precision issues

- OpenGL uses column major order (so the rows in opengl are actually the columns in the standard matrix)
