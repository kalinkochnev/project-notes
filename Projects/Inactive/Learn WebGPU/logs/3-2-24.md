# Today's plans
I really want to try and get a forward kinematics simulation setup using web gpu. So I want to display all the reference frames and have a kinematic chain follow a path.
I *know* i could use ros. but that's silly.

I am trying to follow the tutorial here for textures and bind groups. 

My goal is to display a coordinate frame with the 3 axes and hopefully some visible line thickness.

Here are some ideas on how to draw a line with thickness (I will probably just make a few rectangles)

here is also a cool demo for a more advanced technique
