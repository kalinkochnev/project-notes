- Wood glue is harden/stronger than wood itself
	- Don't fill gaps w/ wood glue. 
- Jigs are used for holding wood together in order to apply a screw at an angle
- Nails stronger in shear, screw stronger in holding pieces together

# Wood grains
- The location of the cut of wood affects grain
- Avoid gluing end grains

# Machines
- S4S wood is already squared and can buy from home depot
- Sequence of machines is Jointer -> Planer -> Table saw to square wood. 

## Jointer
- Used to remove small amounts of wood from 2D plane.
- Used to create perfect 90 degree edges for your first cuts to use as a reference for everything else
- Useful for rough cut wood to cut off edges and faces to make smooth
- Kind of like a deli slicer but for wood

## Planer
- Like an upside down jointer, but used to flatten the top surface
- Used to make two surfaces perfectly parallel to one another
- Need to use jointer first because any surface unevenness will be projected onto other side

### Snipe
- This is an artifact of how the wood is inserted into a planer machine if pressure is not applied on the backend of the wood being inserted. It gets sucked in by the rollers and causes

## Table saw
- **Ripping:** along the grain of the wood
- **Cross cut:** across the grain of the wood

### Sleds
- A form used to make the cuts you want on a table saw
*ex: vertical cut*

## Band saw
- Always need an entry point
- Good for intricate designs

## Scroll saw
- Like a band saw, but the blade moves up and down instead of revolves around the band saw
- Good for detail cuts
- Can do internal cuts if you create a hole

## Compound miter saw (chop saw)
- Used for cutting wood to length
- Good for smaller

## Panel saw
- Used for straight cuts in sheet goods

## Drill press
- Stationary drill

## Wood lathe
"jazz woodworking"

## Router table
- Useful for getting special edges (like dovetails)
- Can ONLY MOVE LEFT
- Can use a template to get the table to follow along a piece of wood and transfer a template

## Fine woodworking tools
- need special certification
- Hand carving and planing
