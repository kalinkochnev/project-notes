# Recap
Made inkscape designs of most of the main pages. I think what I've outlined is like a good MVP that is actually useful today. Versus adding some features like ChatGPT and maybe not getting that much value.

I plan to do the settings of how often to scrape, etc, with a config file.

Additionally, I learned how to use CURL to make a request and JQ to parse the json. JQ is exactly what I need for my app so I don't need a thousand complicated fields for my app.

Also I did some research on how to program the diff feature. This problem is called the "Longest common subsequence". There is a [research paper](http://www.xmailserver.org/diff2.pdf) and a [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/805626/diff-algorithm) post.
