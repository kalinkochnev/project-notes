The links for a robot arm are essentially cantilever beams. Need a truss design that distributes load from one end to the other efficiently

I have a parameter that controls the number of trusses that occur
Let $l_{off}$ be the width of the offset of the link shape
Let $l_{aspect}$ be the width/height ratio of the original link (5:24)
Let $\theta$ be the truss angle
So $l_{aspect}l_{length}=l_{width}$
Let the remaining width after the offset be $l_{width}-2*l_{off}$


The total length of the truss pair (left leaning and right leaning) is
$$
2*\left( l_{off} + \frac{l_{width}-2*l_{off}}{\tan \theta} \right)
$$

```
2*(#link_offset + (#link_len * #link_aspect_ratio -  2*#link_offset)/tan(#truss_angle))
```
