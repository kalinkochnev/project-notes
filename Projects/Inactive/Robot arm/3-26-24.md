# Today's plans
[[3-24-24]]
 - [x] Remeasure motor horn
 - [x] Fix motor horn model
 - [x] base bottom height 
 - [x] Made brush holder right size
# Plans for next time
- [ ] ~~Turns out the brush hold is completely wack. Just use a zip tie. Make a port for it to slide through~~ I decided to use rubber bands instead of zipties
- [x] The slot for the motor in base bottom is way too small. may have forgotten to add offset. But increase even further to allow more wiggle room to place motor

- [x] Make base thinner
- [x] Give about 0.3-0.5mm of margin for the height of the base
- [x] Replace the pole motor hole in base bottom with horizontal connection to outer wall, with chamfer
# Measurements
- Space from outermost OD center horn to first hole OD is 2.1mm
	- From same OD to last hole OD is 11.00mm 
- Full length horn is 38mm (this is correct on the model)
-  servo big screw head is 6.04mm
- space between OD of small holes is 1.70mm
-   8.99mm OD

- Height from motor bottom to base top should be 47mm

Motor connector
- motor side: 6.54mm
- End connector: 7.66mm

**Story time** I wanted to share something cool I learned a few days ago with you all. So the back story is I lost my cheap battery powered caliper and I needed to get a new one since I'm doing doing a lot of cad for my robotics project. However I disliked having to buy batteries just to operate a measuring tool. I thought my only option was a dial caliper, which looks like this

I didn't want a dial since that's just another mechanical point of failure. However there is actually another type of caliper I didn't know about called a Vernier caliper. It uses a pretty neat trick

So when I first saw this I was kind of confused. How could putting these extra scales (the top/bottom ones) result in finer measurement since they are about the same size as the main scale markings (edited)

The way you use this caliper is a bit different. So if you put something inbetween the jaws, first you look at the primary scale to get the first few digits (lets say we're using mm)

If we look at the bottom scale, the 0 is between 0.3 and 0.4cm. Our goal is to estimate a few more digits if we can (edited)

So the way we get the extra digits is looking at how the bottom and top scales align. The point at which the lines perfectly line up with one another is where you take the measurement. So in this case we see that the lines match at 5.8 on the bottom scale (see in red) (edited)

To get our final answer we take our first estimate of `0.3cm + 5.8 * (bottom scale size) = 0.3cm + 29 ticks *0.02mm = 3.58 mm`

It still seems strange that we can be more precise than the either scale.

The trick is that the spacing of the bottom scale is a fraction of the top scale. Lets say about 0.9 * top scale = bottom scale (not true to the picture) (edited)

If we look closely we can see that when both scales are lined up at 0, the other lines don't quite match up

So if we look at the **1** on the bottom scale, according to the scale on my caliper, the offset between the **1** and the closest line on top is 0.1mm since there are 5 ticks of each 0.02. For **2**, the offset is 0.2mm, for **3** the offset is 0.3mm . And for **10** they completely align since 50 ticks * 0.02mm = 1mm
    
The gist is when you compare when the top and bottom scales line up, you are essentially able to measure in increments of that offset between marks of the bottom and top scale
