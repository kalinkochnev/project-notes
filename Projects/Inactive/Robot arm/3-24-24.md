# Today's plans
- [ ] Attempt to assemble the arm
# Plans for next time

# Notes
- The holes of the servo horn do not align with the holes of the 3D model. Need to re measure myself with a caliper.
- The screw hole for the motor horn is a lot bigger than it needs to be on the middle arm (is correct for base-top)

- For the bottom base I forgot to account for the wire coming out. The motor has to be flipped around for the actual orientation. So on the internal screw hole placement, add a slot for the wires
- Also I should make the slot for the motor bigger. There is not enough wiggle room

- The height of the bottom base needs to be a little higher in order to be flush
