# Today's plans
- [x] Configure respeaker on rp
- [ ] Stream audio from rp to laptop via client server
- [ ] Prototype sound localization using rust and streaming audio
# Recap
Lots of silly mistakes happened
- `localhost:<port>` or `127.0.0.1` only accepts connections locally. So DO NOT use when trying to connect to an external device on the network
- `0.0.0.0` allows any ipv4 connections

- Can easily send a udp packet with echo: (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9696129/how-to-send-only-one-udp-packet-with-netcat)
```
echo -n "hello" >/dev/udp/100.101.81.101/2555```
```

- Channels are screwed up on the respeaker. Possible explanations:
	- Respeaker mics are dead -> test by trying `arecord` on pi
		- I think this is the most likely bc all the other channels look fine but there's all this extra noise
	- I am writing to the wav file wrong -> look into parameters like bit depth (not sure what it does. Something with bits per sample?)
	-

# Plans for next time
# Notes
- Used tailscale to ssh to raspberry pi easily
- Got audio drivers working with raspberry pi using this repo https://github.com/HinTak/seeed-voicecard
- We can do bare metal programming without an OS on the RP with rust https://github.com/rp-rs/rp-hal

**Use the `inet` ip from ifconfig** when sshing into pi (can also find it on tailscale)
