# About me
scr

My mission, and dream, is to create educational content to inspire everyone to have an engineering mindset, or even study it! I attempt to develop solutions for complex engineering problems that are important to me, and show that anyone can be an engineer. Failure is a part of the process!

I have worked on passion projects for quite a while now, almost since elementary school depending on how you count the years. But my most recent accomplishments include:

**2022 NASA BIG Idea Challenge Finalist** [Link here]()
I lead a team of 20 undergraduates with several others to compete in the BIG Idea Challenge. NASA [awarded my team]() with $150,000 to pursue lunar robotics research for an entire year (2 semesters and a summer). 

It was an eye-opening and an extremely humbling experience. My team and I missed the mark by a long shot, and in a highly public manner. Now our duct-taped, falling-apart prototype is forever immortalized in [National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/lunar-robot-snakes-explore-the-moon-nasa). Despite this, I learned a lot about how to build a product, and also what can go wrong. My main goal from this experience is to learn from my mistakes and help others make sure they don't make the same ones.

**2021 Highest Honors at the New York State Science Congress** [Link here]()
This was a state wide science fair that I participated senior year of high school with [Rohan Menon](https://www.rohanmenon.com/) and [Jacob Yanoff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-yanoff-56b882168/). Our hope was to develop a wearable, and discreet, device that could serve as an alternative to hearing aids for the deaf. We developed a prototype which won the highest honors at the state science fair.

Today, I am in the beginning of a new phase in my life, one where I figure out how to give back to the communities that have shaped me. Even though I am not the world's foremost engineer, I want to foster a community of ["learning in public"](). This is where one leaves a trail of notes and documentation that captures their learning journey while also exposing themselves to feedback from others. The purposes is twofold, to learn from others and so others can learn from you. Developing my portfolio is my first step on this journey. In the future, I will be creating video content to post alongside my journeys.

Post-NASA BIG Idea Challenge, I am working with the University of Connecticut administration to build infrastructure for students to gain the necessary skills and have access to tools in order to compete in future challenges. Additionally, the remaining members of the group hope to establish a student lab to serve as mentors and provide learning experiences for passionate engineering undergraduates. In the same way that NASA took a chance with us, I hope to provide a similar opportunity to others. 

I am working on a second version of the Resonant project (the NYS science fair submission). There is a lot of potential applications with this technology in regards to accessibility and robotic sensing. I still have a lot left to explore with the fascinating signal processing and math behind it as well. It is my first project I am hoping to document in its entirety on my site and YouTube!
