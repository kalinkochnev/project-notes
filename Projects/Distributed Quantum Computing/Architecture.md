- Each node has knowledge of the network topology and distances
- Computational nodes run unitary operators on themselves directly, otherwise have to entangle with other nodes directly

# Parameters
N = number of nodes
L = length of fiber connecting neighboring nodes
B = Quality of repeaters. Probability of bell measurement succeeding
D = Amount of noise on channels. Probability of EPR pairs decohering
