`pair_ent()`
- Has something to do with entangling two graphs

## Important variables
`Ed`
- The last element for each item in `Ed` has something to do with decoherence (1451)
- The number of items in `Ed` is the number of channels
- Is the result of `path_ent`

`path_ent(G,Q,D, Pt)`
- Contains code relating to the probability of success (844)
- G2 contains the trusted nodes of G
- Returns the graph 

Is `prio` priority?

`R1` returns `Pt, prio`

Priority has something to do with the balancing

`Pt` is an array of paths? Is it a list of the nodes?
`Q` is error in raw key pool?
`RK_ij` is the length of the secret key?
