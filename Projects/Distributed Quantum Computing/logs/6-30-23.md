# Recap
I had a meeting with Swamy today. We went over the outline and it sounds like we agree on the plan. We setup a github repository with the code. Afterwards I spent a lot of time going through the old code to try and understand how the probability calculation was implemented. The old code was literally shit in terms of readability and best practices. I wrote some regexes to remove some of the useless comments and formatted the files. I eventually found the `path_ent()` method which is the calculation that ended up confusing us. Apparently it is a lot of straightforward and follows equation 2 from the paper exactly. We can start implementing the rewrite soon. Probably tomorrow.
