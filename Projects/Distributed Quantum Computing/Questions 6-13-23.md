- Have done some research and I am not sure I understand what we are trying to solve. 
- With the QKD there is a clear sender and receiver. Who is getting the input and how is the output received?
- Qiskit gives us a directed acyclic graph of a particular circuit. Is the issue just a matter of mapping a qiskit circuit to our unideal simulation?
