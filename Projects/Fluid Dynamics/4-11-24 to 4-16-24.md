# Plans
- [x] Try parallelizing the optimizer to plot more finely
- [x] Try messing around with "time step" of optimizer
- [ ] Try reproducing figure 2 with ode45
- [ ] Try to improve theory of LMI textbook (boyd) 
	- [ ] time dependent P?
		- [ ] look at papers for this (lyapunov stability linear time varying systems, nonautonomous system)

Nonlinear systems textbook - Khalil 



# Plans for next time
# Recap
- The convex optimized growth rate is insensitive to finer timer steps or longer time ranges
	- Tried running w/ T=0, 2000  n_steps=3000 as well as T=0,10000 n_steps=1000 and growth rate was still 0.0413
- Got parfor to work for convex optimization code
