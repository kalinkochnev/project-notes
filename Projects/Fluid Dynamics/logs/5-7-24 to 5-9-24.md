- [x] Load env variables into bash file



# Plans for next time
# Recap
- **I may have caught a mistake**. In `figure2a.m` we have that 
```
% background shear flow amplitude
au = sqrt(2*fparams.Pr/fparams.Ri);
fparams.Au = @(t) au*cos(fparams.omega *t);
fparams.Av = @(t) 0;

% we can numerically integrate for more complicated functions
% but for the simple case of Au = au cos(wt) eval integral from 0 to inf analytically
fparams.Bv = @(t) 0;
fparams.Bu = @(t) (1/fparams.omega) * sin(fparams.omega * t); 
```

However I think `params.Bu` is incorrect. It should include `au` 
`fparams.Bu = @(t) (au/fparams.omega) * sin(fparams.omega * t);`

- Apparently the Radko paper has an appendix I never noticed.

- I am not sure if I am using the right prandtl numbers for figure 4

# Questions
- For figure 4 they plot the maximum growth rate for different states. In Eq. 24 they state that the maximal growth rate occurs in the limit as you approach the origin. Should I also use this same assumption? Specifically $\kappa = 10^{-6}$
