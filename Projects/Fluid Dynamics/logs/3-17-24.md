Worked 2 hours
# Today's plans 
- [x] Understand the time dependent pendulum code
	- [x] How to extract the upper bound on lambda 
- [x] Update fluid system derivation to express the system in terms of density (can reduce the number of variables necessary)
# Plans for next time
- [ ] Derive the $\textbf{M}$ matrix in the paper (write the ODEs in matrix form)
