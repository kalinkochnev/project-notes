# Current plans
- [ ] Check code that generates figure 8 plot
- [ ] Make fixes suggested by Chang (or check his branch when he uploads it)
	- [ ] Is it really equivalent to setting Au equal to 0?
- [x] Check what happens we don't make same mistake as Radko
- [ ] Radko Geophysical Letters Paper
	- [ ]  Rederive matrix using
	- [ ] Try to reproduce figure 2
# Recap
- When we made the fixes to the matrix, this is what we get. It is still wrong. I also tried setting Bu = 0 since Bu = integral(Au)

**5/31/24**
We replicated figure 2 and figure 1a from the thermohaline paper! 

Figure 2 w/ ode

Figure 1a with ODE

There is a problem with the LMI results though

# Notes

# Questions
- Why is it equivalent to say that Au=0? Doesn't that delete several terms that do contribute something?
- What $k$ value to use?
- The $f$ param is not used. The paper says it does not account for the coriolis force? So do I set it to 0?
- $m_{0}$ is also not given
